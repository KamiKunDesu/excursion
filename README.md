## General info

This project is a response to a codecademy prompt project where I was given some image and video resources as well as a design mock and a redline mock and asked to build a website based on the mocks. The project itself is a mock up for a fake travel app called excursion and the project itself was simple - taking roughly an hour to complete.

## Technologies

This project was created with:

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Setup

There is no necessary extra set up for this project as it is simply a web page downloadable by most web browsers. The browser I used during the development process was Google Chrome but most modern browsers should be able to load this page.
